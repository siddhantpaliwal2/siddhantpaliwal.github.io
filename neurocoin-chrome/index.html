    <p>Neurocoin is currently in the testing phase. Refer to testing guidelines below.</p>
    <h1>Neurocoin</h1>
    <p>Neurocoin is a productivity coin that intends to leverage the power of a suite of applications across your desktop, browser, phone, and tablets to track your productivity and reward you based on your efforts. The more productive you are, the more you earn. Neurocoin hopes to eventually expose every user to discounted “brain-boosting” services such as books, academic material, podcasts, wellness subscriptions, e-books, and much more. These discounts will be redeemable with Neurocoin.</p>
    <h2>Rewards</h2>
    <p>To be released. You will have access to a storefront of items you can purchase with Neurocoin.</p>
    <h2>How the Chrome Extension Works</h2>
    <p>Neurocoin for Chrome uses AI to determine if you’re on a productive website or not. A student may commonly use Bruin Learn and will observe an appreciation in the number of coins they receive as they spend more time on the website. Simply put, time is proportional to Neurocoin. When a student switches to a site such as Netflix, they will see that they stop accumulating Neurocoin. Long inactivity is also tracked for each website and that also stops earning Neurocoin.</p>
    <h3>Algorithm</h3>
    <p>Neurocoin uses fine-tuned AI to determine productivity. While there may be instances that are a grey area, we correctly identify most productive and unproductive sites.</p>
    <h3>Modes</h3>
    <p>Neurocoin for Chrome has two modes: Grind and Normal. Grind mode will notify you when you're being unproductive, which can help you earn more Neurocoin. Normal mode will not notify you when you are unproductive, and is a better mode for people who would like it to run in the background.</p>
    <p>And that’s about it till now! Refer below to testing guidelines below if you are currently testing Neurocoin.</p>
    <p>Neurocoin docs are still in development, please contact <a href="mailto:paliwal.siddhant@gmail.com" class="contact">paliwal.siddhant@gmail.com</a> for further questions.</p>
    <h2>Testing Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Congratualtions on being a tester for Neurocoin, hopefully you'll be a part of something huge. These are the steps you should be following</p>

      <li>3. Visit chrome://extensions on Google Chrome.</li>
      <li>4. Check your top right corner. Your developer mode should be toggled on. If developer mode is turned off, turn it on. </li>
      <li>5. Now click "Load unpacked" in the top left corner and navigate to the folder "neurocoin-chrome".</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Testing guidelines</h3>
    <p>Here are some things to keep in mind while testing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>1. Do you feel like accumulating Neurocoin?</li>
      <li>2. How useful is grindmode?</li>
      <li>3. Do you think your Neurocoin count is reflective of your productivity? Remember one coin is one minute of work.</li>
