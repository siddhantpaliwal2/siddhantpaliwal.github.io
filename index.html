    <p>Neurocoin is currently in the testing phase. Refer to testing guidelines below.</p>
    <h1>Neurocoin</h1>
    <p>Neurocoin is a productivity coin that intends to leverage the power of a suite of applications across your desktop, browser, phone, and tablets to track your productivity and reward you based on your efforts. The more productive you are, the more you earn. Neurocoin hopes to eventually expose every user to discounted “brain-boosting” services such as books, academic material, podcasts, wellness subscriptions, e-books, and much more. These discounts will be redeemable with Neurocoin.</p>
    <h2>How the Chrome Extension Works</h2>
    <p>Neurocoin for Chrome uses AI to determine if you’re on a productive website or not. A student may commonly use Bruin Learn and will observe an appreciation in the number of coins they receive as they spend more time on the website. Simply put, time is proportional to Neurocoin. When a student switches to a site such as Netflix, they will see that they stop accumulating Neurocoin. Long inactivity is also tracked for each website and that also stops earning Neurocoin.</p>
    <p>And that’s about it till now! Refer below to testing guidelines below if you are currently testing Neurocoin.</p>
    <p>Neurocoin docs are still in development, please contact <a href="mailto:paliwal.siddhant@gmail.com" class="contact">paliwal.siddhant@gmail.com</a> for further questions.</p>
    <h2>Testing Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Neurocoin isn’t an official cryptocurrency, but for now each coin is worth $0.016 which means an hour of productivity will earn you $1. As a tester, you will receive a lump sum cash payment at the end of a testing week that will reflect your coin balance. Please report any bugs to <a href="mailto:paliwal.siddhant@gmail.com" class="contact">paliwal.siddhant@gmail.com</a>.</p>
